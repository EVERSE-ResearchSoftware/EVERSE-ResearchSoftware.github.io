As part of our engagement with and within the EVERSE Network of Research Software quality, we organsie a recurrent webinar series on all things Research Software Quality (RSQ). This is coordinated by [WP1](workpackages/01_framework_european_network/) and [WP5](/workpackages/05_capacity_and_recognition/).

The webinars will happen monthly, alternating between a general RSQ topic and training session. For this we will have our project members to present what we are working on, as well as inviting researchers (who code), research software engineers, professionals from related fields and Science Cluster members to give an outside view.

We plan to have the webinars in the second week of every month during mid-mornings or afternoons, but time and date might change, depending on the availablity of our speakers. In case you can't make it to one of the sessions, don't worry, we will record all talks and upload them to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@EVERSE-Network).
