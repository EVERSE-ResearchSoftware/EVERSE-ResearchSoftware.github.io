We are excited to invite you to the [launch event](https://indico.cern.ch/e/eversenetworklaunch) for the EVERSE Network of Research Software Quality at **10h CET on Tuesday 18 February**. We invite everyone who is interested in software quality to join us!

The aim of this event is to introduce the EVERSE project and why one of its charges is to setup a network. We will present some of [our ideas](/network) about what role the Network can play. However, we also want to hear from you.

- What issues does your community face with its research software?
- What benefits can you envisage from engaging with other software experts in science?
- What would you like to contribute to a software quality network?

Please [register for the event](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1501988/registrations/113770/) so we can stay in touch and build a strong and effective Network for Software Quality.
