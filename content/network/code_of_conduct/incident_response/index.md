Information on how to report a [Code of Conduct](/network/code_of_conduct/)
(CoC) incident is outlined in our Code of Conduct Incident Reporting Guidelines.

The checklists below outline the steps any EVERSE network member or participant
in an EVERSE event can take during a potential Code of Conduct incident before
reporting it to the Code of Conduct committee (CoCc). You may encounter
challenging situations and have limited experience or training to feel
comfortable enforcing the CoC. These guidelines are meant to help guide you
through the process of supporting other community members and yourself during an
incident.

All EVERSE network members should feel empowered to enforce the Code of
Conduct.

Ideally, we would all be able to defuse an incident. In practice, we have
varying comfort with situations depending on our current experience and the
environment. Below are ways that you can be supportive and steps that you can
take during or after an incident.

If you can, move from being a bystander to being a Code of Conduct first
responder. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don’t
feel comfortable intervening, but feel someone should, please submit a report.
For in-person events, please immediately contact a workshop host or instructor
so that they can assist you in implementing the Immediate Response Checklist as
listed below, and help submit a report to the CoCc.

## Immediate Response

The initial response to an incident is very important and will set the tone for
EVERSE community. Depending on the severity and/or details of the
incident, an immediate response may be required. If an incident involves
physical danger or involves a threat to anyone’s safety (e.g. threats of
violence), any member of the community may – and should – act immediately to
protect safety. This can include contacting emergency or crisis resources.

## Ongoing Incident

If an incident is ongoing, whether in-person or online, any community member
(workshop host, instructor, helper) may act immediately and employ any of the
tools available to the community member to pacify the situation. In situations
where an individual community member acts immediately, they must inform the
workshop host as soon as possible and report their actions to the CoCc for
review within 24 hours of the incident. Should there be a need for an immediate
response, please see the Immediate Response Checklist.

## Checklists for Responding to an Incident

### Immediate Response Checklist

- Assess whether you need a first-responder (law enforcement, etc.) to immediately respond to the incident. If so, ask the reporter to stay with you and call the appropriate emergency response number.
- If there is any general threat to participants and/or the safety of anyone attending a EVERSE event, contact the emergency response number established.
- If individuals are physically safe, contact law enforcement or security only at the reporter’s request.
- Follow any local guidelines for handling incidents, including if you have a legal reporting role.

### In-Person and Online Event Checklist

- Ensure participants are safe.
- If participants are not safe, refer to the Immediate Response Checklist.
- Ask the reporter to report the incident via the Code of Conduct contact.
- If they would like your help or feel more comfortable if you complete the report, talk to them or communicate via email/online call to get their inputs in getting as much detail as possible, and help submit the report with their assistance.
- Inform the workshop host or the listed contact person (such as a CoC facilitator) that there was an incident and that a report was submitted via the incident report form. If the incident involves the workshop host or instructor, report the incident directly to the CoCc via the incident report form.

### Online Communications Channels Checklist

- Inform the event host/meeting facilitator that there was an issue and send a report.
- Save screenshot of any online interaction where the issue occured and share in your report.
- If the incident involves the event host/meeting facilitator, please complete the incident report form and rest assured that confidentiality and your experience in our community is our first priority.

If a community member has violated the CoC via an online event, the CoCc can enact a short-term Termed Suspension, and the reportee’s privileges to all EVERSE communication channels could be suspended until the CoCc has concluded their investigation of the reported incident.

Individuals reported often get upset, defensive, or deny the report. Allow them to give any additional details about the incident. However, remember:

- It does not matter if they did not intend to hurt anyone; their behaviour still impacted participants negatively.
- It is not your job to reassure or forgive them.
- Do not allow the reported person to make an apology to the reporter or impacted person. Often an apology centers the reported person’s feelings and not the person who was impacted. You may accept their apology and offer to pass it on, but you’re not required to if you think it would negatively impact the reporter.
