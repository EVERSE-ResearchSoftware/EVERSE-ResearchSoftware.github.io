The diagram below illustrated the steps to be taken after a reported breach of
the EVERSE Code of Conduct:

First report → assess if there is a CoC report and clear breach
No report or breach → respond with an explanation to the reporter
Breach identified → set up a first meeting with the CoCc (Read about Incident Response Group in CoCc Governance) to collectively identify specific issues and breaches: 

* If a specific breach/issue was not identified → reply to the reporter.
* If a specific breach/issue was identified → email the reporter/reportee as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process.
* If it was undecided that a breach/issue occurred → hold a meeting with the reporter/reportee as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process → Hold a second meeting with the CoCc to identify consequence/next steps as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process.
