The EVERSE Code of Conduct (CoC) presents guidelines for respectful behaviour and a safe environemnt for all EVERSE-related activities. Please read it carefully; you can find a summary [here](#code-of-conduct---summary) and the [full description](#code-of-conduct-detailed-view) below.
## <font color="40A3DC"> Code of Conduct - Summary </font>

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by the EVERSE Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any CoC incidents are resolved. Any form of behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:

1. Use welcoming and inclusive language.
2. Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences.
3. Gracefully accept constructive criticism and assume others are acting with a positive intent when unsure. 
4. Focus on what is best for the community.
5. Show courtesy and respect towards other community members. Address and acknowledge everyone equally and ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to make comments, ask questions and voice opinions.
6. Use social media responsibly, respecting both individuals and the organisation hosting the meeting.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to the EVERSE Code of Conduct Committee by everse-ccc@lists.certh.gr, who will take the appropriate action to address the situation.

### Part 1: Introduction

The EVERSE Network is a community-led project. We value the involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. \
To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in EVERSE activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This CoC applies to all spaces managed by EVERSE including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack, Mastodon, X, BlueSky and LinkedIn. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the CoC. \
The EVERSE Code of Conduct Committee is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. It can be contacted by emailing everse-ccc@lists.certh.gr . All reports will be reviewed by the CoC Committee and will be kept confidential.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any EVERSE event/platform include: 
* Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group. 
* Causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation. 
* Violent threats or language directed against another person. 
* The display of sexual or violent images. 
* Unwelcome sexual attention. 
* Nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact.

* Continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop. 
* Publication of private communication without consent.

#### Part 2.3: Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any EVERSE events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organisers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or engage the EVERSE Code of Conduct Committee to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.
