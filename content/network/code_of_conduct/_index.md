## Code of Conduct (Summary View)

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by The EVERSE Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form of behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:

1. Use welcoming and inclusive language
2. Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
3. Gracefully accept constructive criticism and assume others are acting with a positive intent when unsure. 
4. Focus on what is best for the community
5. Show courtesy and respect towards other community members. Address and acknowledge everyone equally and ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to make comments, ask questions and voice opinions.
6. Use social media responsibly, respecting both individuals and the organisation hosting the meeting

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to The EVERSE Code of Conduct Committee by DEFINE CONTACT MEANS, who will take the appropriate action to address the situation.

## Code of Conduct (Detailed View)

The code of conduct in more detail.

### Part 1. Introduction

The EVERSE Network is a community-led project. We value the involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.
To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in EVERSE activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by EVERSE including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack, Mastodon, X and LinkedIn. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.
The EVERSE Code of Conduct Committee is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. It can be contacted by emailing everse-ccc@lists.certh.gr . All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential.

### Part 2. EVERSE Code of Conduct

EVERSE is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to participants in our activities or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Event, workshop and meeting hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which EVERSE resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information.

#### Part 2.1 Expected behaviour

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all EVERSE events and platforms:
Use welcoming and inclusive language
Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
Gracefully accept constructive criticism and assume others are acting with a positive intent when unsure. 
Focus on what is best for the community
Show courtesy and respect towards other community members. Address and acknowledge everyone equally and ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to make comments, ask questions and voice opinions.
Use social media responsibly, respecting both individuals and the organisation hosting the meetingNote: See the four social rules for further recommendations.

#### Part 2.2 Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any EVERSE event/platform include:
written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
violent threats or language directed against another person
the display of sexual or violent images
unwelcome sexual attention
nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
insults or put downs
sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
excessive swearing
incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
publication of private communication without consent

#### Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any EVERSE events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organisers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or engage the EVERSE Code of Conduct Committee to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.
Process Flow Diagram
The diagram below illustrates the following steps in following a Code of Conduct report.
First report -> assess if there is a CoC report and clear breach
No report or breach -> respond with an explanation to the reporter
Breach identified -> set up a first meeting with the CoCc (Read about Incident Response Group in CoCc Governance) to collectively identify specific issues and breaches:

* If a specific breach/issue was not identified -> reply to the reporter
* If a specific breach/issue was identified -> email the reporter/reportee as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process
* If it was undecided that a breach/issue occurred -> hold a meeting with the reporter/reportee as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process -> Hold a second meeting with the CoCc to identify consequence/next steps as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process

Reporting guidelines were also revised to include alternate contact points and a reporting form with the procedure was added. In 2019, an appeal process, the procedure for following up with a reportee, terminology, CoC incident response procedure, termed suspension checklist, expanded clauses for conflicts of interest, and committee membership agreement were included.
