Below is a summary of the EVERSE Code of Conduct. Continue reading for a more detailed description of the CoC.
For more information please review our:

* Incident Response Guidelines
* Incident Reporting Guidelines
* Incident Response Procedure
* Termed Suspension Guidelines

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by The EVERSE Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form of behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:

1. Use welcoming and inclusive language
2. Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
3. Gracefully accept constructive criticism and assume others are acting with a positive intent when unsure. 
4. Focus on what is best for the community
5. Show courtesy and respect towards other community members. Address and acknowledge everyone equally and ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to make comments, ask questions and voice opinions.
6. Use social media responsibly, respecting both individuals and the organisation hosting the meeting

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to The EVERSE Code of Conduct Committee by completing this form, who will take the appropriate action to address the situation.

### Part 1. Introduction

The EVERSE Network is a community-led project. We value the involvement of everyone in the community.

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.
To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in EVERSE activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by EVERSE including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack, Mastodon, X and LinkedIn. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

#### Part 2.2 Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any EVERSE event/platform include:
written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
violent threats or language directed against another person
the display of sexual or violent images
unwelcome sexual attention
nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact

#### Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any EVERSE events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organisers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or engage the EVERSE Code of Conduct Committee to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.
Process Flow Diagram
The diagram below illustrates the following steps in following a Code of Conduct report.
First report -> assess if there is a CoC report and clear breach
No report or breach -> respond with an explanation to the reporter
Breach identified -> set up a first meeting with the CoCc (Read about Incident Response Group in CoCc Governance) to collectively identify specific issues and breaches:

* If a specific breach/issue was not identified -> reply to the reporter
* If a specific breach/issue was identified -> email the reporter/reportee as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process
* If it was undecided that a breach/issue occurred -> hold a meeting with the reporter/reportee as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process -> Hold a second meeting with the CoCc to identify consequence/next steps as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process
