## Network of Research Software Quality ##

The EVERSE project is committed to improving the quality of software in European research in the international context. EVERSE will launch a Network of Research Software Quality to allow us to work with individuals and partner organisations to achieve this common goal.

### Vision ###
Our vision of the EVERSE Network of Research Software Quality is to establish a Community of Practice around improving the quality of research software in Europe and beyond. EVERSE and partners work to provide standard and documented practices around tools and training for software developers, researchers who code and research software engineers and service providers, to help them write better code. We help define the meaning and principles of software quality for the research domain. We work for enhanced recognition for software developers contributing to research activities.

### Value ###
Members of EVERSE and of the future European network can:

* Become a member of the de facto EOSC Association expert group on software
* Help shape software quality practices in Europe by:
    * Providing input and feedback to the  best practices captured within EVERSE 
    * Contributing and receiving feedback on their community or research projectâ€™s needs
* Participate in defining the key aspects around recognition for research software activities, including design, implementing, maintaining and improving software quality
* Participate in task forces and expert groups that the network will have in the future
* Join software quality seminars, webinars and other events, and have the opportunity to co-develop the agenda
* Be in touch with like minded researchers and developers
* Get access to EVERSE communication channels


We will support our members in establishing their own local communities for software quality, and help to liaise and coordinate with regional/national activities for software.
