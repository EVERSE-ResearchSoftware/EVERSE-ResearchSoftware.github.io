EVERSE [Work Package 3](/workpackages/03_tools_and_services/) on *Tools and Services* is organising an interactive **online** workshop to examine which tools and services researchers use to improve the quality of research software, and how they use them!

## Save the date: Monday 10th February 2025, 10:00-16:00 CET

Please register your interest [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=sAafLmkWiUWHiRCgaTTcYY8mG3jqdkZDlfFoAQVJfklUNVNQMEVQUDQ4SUg1MVpXRzRIMDZONDYwQi4u). 


## Is this workshop for you? Join us if you:

* Work with or develop research software.
* Want to improve software and make it higher quality (considering FAIRness, sustainability, portability, testing, security, etc.).
* Both non-EVERSE & EVERSE members are welcome. We also encourage members belonging to any of the five [EOSC Science Clusters](https://science-clusters.eu) to take part.

## Workshop goals and purpose:

* Opportunity for knowledge exchange & discussion on relevant tools used to improve the quality of research software, learn from other communities.
* Capture of existing practices.
* Identification of gaps in available tooling.

We will be circulating a draft agenda and further details closer to the date. The event is all day, but we welcome everyone to attend for as long as possible, if full attendance is no option due to other commitments.

Please share with any groups and colleagues you think might be interested in the event.
