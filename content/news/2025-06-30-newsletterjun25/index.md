Summer is up ahead with work, vacation and our EVERSE Newsletter. We're coming in with big news about a collaboration with African RSEs, updates on conferences and our Work Package series continues with WP 4. In the heat, working can be hard, so we came up with a curated "summer reading" list: a mix and match of RSE-specific and non-specific books, webpages, videos and tricks to explore. We wish you an enjoyable summer and read you soon!

You can read the newsletter as a PDF [here](Newsletter-2025-06.pdf).
