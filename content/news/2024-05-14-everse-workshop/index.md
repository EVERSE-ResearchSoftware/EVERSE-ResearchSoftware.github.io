The main goal of the workshop is to serve as a platform for EVERSE to showcase the work of the project, and receive input from all relevant stakeholders, while facilitating networking and collaboration opportunities between all participants.

The expectation is for participants to bring with them their communities’ best practices and services on research software (including, but not limited to, quality, management, sustainability, excellence, etc.) in order to engage with EVERSE, while also establishing a bidirectional channel of communication moving forward.
