After a hot summer, we're back with cool minds to tackle the last months ahead. EVERSE is at its halftime and we are more than happy to introduce some of our collaborations and partners outside of Europe. Our project aims to connect with African RSE movements and we've especially been working with our partners at Talarify, the Science for Africa Foundations and UbuntuNet Connect. This and more awaits you in our September edition of "Into the EVERSE".
