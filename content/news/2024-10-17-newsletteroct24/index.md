Our first newsletter is finally ready! It's been a busy first half of a year for us and we wanted to bring you up-to-date.
*Into the EVERSE* is a quarterly newsletter that will summarise our activities, milestones and latest achievements.
The first edition introduces the project itself with an interview with our project leader Fotis Psomopoulos; reports on meetings we've been to, especially the International Research Software Funders Workshop; talks about two launched services (RSQkit and the EVERSE Network); and an outlook on where research software engineering will be highlighted in the next months.
