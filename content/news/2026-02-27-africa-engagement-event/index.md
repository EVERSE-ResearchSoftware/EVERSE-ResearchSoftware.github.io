    An EVERSE-Africa Engagement Event
---
We are excited to invite you to the EVERSE Community Engagement Event on **Research Software Quality Across Continents!**

Software created to address the needs of researchers is playing an increasingly important role in many scientific domains, in industry and is having a broader impact. As a result researchers and engineers seek to improve their research software's quality, learn new skills and also seek recognition for their work.

The goal of this event is to share experience across continents on the challenges faced in creating research software and the improving its quality, and to foster both knowledge-sharing and collaboration.

The EVERSE project is pooling the knowledge of best practices for research software quality, initially targeting diverse research communities initially in Europe.  It seeks to identify the tools, metrics and training available in related topics.  Its target is to  work towards having it valued as a first-level contribution to research.

Organised by the EVERSE project, the University of Cape Town's e-Research Center and the Science for Africa Foundation.
