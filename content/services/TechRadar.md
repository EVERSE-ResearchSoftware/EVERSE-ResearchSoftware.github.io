The [**EVERSE Technology Radar**](https://everse.software/TechRadar/) is part of the EVERSE project and serves as a platform to collect, classify, and present tools and services that help assess and enhance Research Software Quality.

It consists of two main elements:

- **A catalogue of tools and services** designed to evaluate, measure, and improve the quality of research software.
- The **TechRadar**, a visual dashboard that displays this catalogue in an accessible and intuitive way.

TechRadar provides a structured overview of research software quality tools and services, systematically organized according to the [EVERSE Quality Dimensions](https://everse.software/RSQKit/rs_quality). While it does not cover every existing tool, it highlights those that meet defined selection criteria, ensuring relevance and usefulness across the EOSC Science Clusters.

Feel free to explore the [TechRadar](https://everse.software/TechRadar/), and provide your comments or suggestions by opening an issue in its [source code repository](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/TechRadar).
