The [**EVERSE Technology Radar**](https://everse.software/TechRadar/) is part of the EVERSE project and serves as a platform to collect, classify, and present tools and services that help assess and enhance Research Software Quality.

It consists of two main elements:

- **A catalogue of tools and services** designed to evaluate, measure, and improve the quality of research software.
- The **TechRadar**, a visual dashboard that displays this catalogue in an accessible and intuitive way.

TechRadar provides a structured overview of research software quality tools and services, systematically organized according to the [EVERSE Quality Dimensions](https://everse.software/RSQKit/rs_quality). While it does not cover every existing tool, it highlights those that meet defined selection criteria, ensuring relevance and usefulness across the EOSC Science Clusters.

Within the EVERSE framework, TechRadar is developed under [Work Package 3 (Tools & Services)](/workpackages/03_tools_and_services/), which focuses on identifying and integrating resources that improve research software quality. It complements other project outputs such as the [RSQKit](https://everse.software/RSQKit/), developed within [WP2](/workpackages/02_best_practices/), which offers guidelines and best practices for achieving software excellence. Together, [RSQKit](https://everse.software/RSQKit/) defines what should be done to ensure quality, while [TechRadar](https://everse.software/TechRadar/) showcases how to do it through the right tools and services.

By bridging knowledge ([WP2](/workpackages/02_best_practices/)), implementation tools ([WP3](https://everse.software/workpackages/03_tools_and_services/)), and community engagement activities ([WP4](/workpackages/04_pilots_and_drivers/), [WP5](/workpackages/05_capacity_and_recognition/)), TechRadar acts as a central hub connecting the different components of the EVERSE ecosystem.

Feel free to explore the [TechRadar](https://everse.software/TechRadar/), and provide your comments or suggestions by opening an issue in its [source code repository](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/TechRadar).
