The **EVERSE Technology Radar** is a curated catalogue and interactive dashboard showcasing tools and services that help assess, measure, and improve the quality of research software. Developed within the EVERSE project, it organizes these resources into **quality dimensions** (segments) such as FAIRness, Maintainability, Security, and Sustainability, and into **rings** reflecting different stages of research software development—from analysis code to research infrastructure. Each tool is carefully reviewed by the curation team before inclusion, ensuring relevance and reliability. The TechRadar provides researchers and developers with a clear, structured overview to identify the most appropriate quality tools for their software’s maturity and specific needs.
