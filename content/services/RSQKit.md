The framework for research software excellence will incorporate aspects involving community curation, quality assessment, and best practices for research software. This collective knowledge will be captured in the [**Research Software Quality toolkit** (RSQKit)](https://everse.software/RSQKit/), a knowledge base to gather and curate expertise that will contribute to high-quality software and code across different disciplines.

By embedding the RSQKit and services into the EOSC Science Clusters, EVERSE will demonstrate improvements in the quality of research software and maximise its reuse, leading to standardised software development practices and sustainable research software. Furthermore, we will drive recognition of software and support career progress for developers, from researchers who code to Research Software Engineers (RSEs), raising their capacity to guarantee software quality.

Visit the [RSQKit](https://everse.software/RSQKit/) to check out the latest advice and training links, and [make comments and suggestions via its Editorial Board](https://everse.software/RSQKit/get_involved). See [RSQKit on GitHub](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit).


RSQKit brings together:
- [Best practices](https://everse.software/RSQKit/your_tasks) [internally and externally sourced and authored](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/issues/224) under the auspicies of [EVERSE WP2](https://everse.software/workpackages/02_best_practices/)
- [Dimensions and Indicators](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/indicators) from EVERSE [WP2](https://everse.software/workpackages/02_best_practices/)/[WP3](https://everse.software/workpackages/03_tools_and_services/)
- [Tools](https://everse.software/TechRadar/overview/) from the [TechRadar](https://everse.software/TechRadar/) of [EVERSE WP3](https://everse.software/workpackages/03_tools_and_services/)
- Information about [Research Software Clusters & Infrastructures](https://everse.software/RSQKit/research_clusters_and_infrastructures) and associated [Research Software Stories](https://everse.software/RSQKit/research_software_stories) from [EVERSE WP4](https://everse.software/workpackages/04_pilots_and_drivers/)
- Associated [collected training resources](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/training) served via the [EVERSE Training Portal](https://everse-training.app.cern.ch/) from [EVERSE WP5](https://everse.software/workpackages/05_capacity_and_recognition/)
- And is a key item mentioned in the outreach and promoted to the [EVERSE Network](https://everse.software/network/) and via [EVERSE WP1](https://everse.software/workpackages/01_framework_european_network/)
