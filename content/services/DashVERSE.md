[**DashVERSE**](https://dashverse.cloud/) is the dashboard prototype specifically developed for the [EVERSE project](https://everse.software/). It serves as a central hub for visualizing the results of research software quality assessments, metrics, and compliance indicators across different scientific clusters and infrastructures.

By integrating data from the [EVERSE indicators and dimensions](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/indicators) and other quality assessment tools, DashVERSE provides actionable insights through role-based dashboards tailored for different stakeholders:

- **[Policy Maker](https://everse.software/RSQKit/policy_maker)**: High-level adoption and compliance overview.
- **[Principal Investigator](https://everse.software/RSQKit/principal_investigator)**: Project-level metrics and action items.
- **[Research Software Engineer](https://everse.software/RSQKit/research_software_engineer)**: Technical metrics and detailed check results.
- **[Researcher Who Codes](https://everse.software/RSQKit/researcher_who_codes)**: Practical guidance and quick improvements.
- **[Trainer](https://everse.software/RSQKit/trainer)**: Training insights and best practices.

DashVERSE is built using a modern cloud-native stack including [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) for visualization, [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/) for data access, and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for data storage.
