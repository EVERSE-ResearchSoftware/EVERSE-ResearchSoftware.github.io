The framework for research software excellence will incorporate aspects involving community curation, quality assessment, and best practices for research software. This collective knowledge will be captured in the **Research Software Quality toolkit** (RSQkit), a knowledge base to gather and curate expertise that will contribute to high-quality software and code across different disciplines.

By embedding the RSQkit and services into the EOSC Science Clusters, EVERSE will demonstrate improvements in the quality of research software and maximise its reuse, leading to standardised software development practices and sustainable research software. Furthermore, we will drive recognition of software and support career progress for developers, from researchers who code to RSEs, raising their capacity to guarantee software quality.

You can find the RSQkit [here](https://everse.software/RSQKit/) - check out the latest comments, and make comments and suggestions.
