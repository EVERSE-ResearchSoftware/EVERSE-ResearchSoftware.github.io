## High Quality Research Software for the Communities by the Communities

### *Software for the Communities by the Communities*

The **EVERSE** project aims to create a framework for research software and code excellence, collaboratively designed and championed by the research communities, in pursuit of building a **European network of Research Software Quality** and setting the foundations of a future **Virtual Institute for Research Software Excellence**.

## Ambition

EVERSE ultimate ambition is to contribute towards a cultural change where research software is recognized as a first-class citizen of the scientific process and the people that contribute to it are credited for their efforts.

EVERSE is coordinated by the [Centre for Research and Technology hellas (CERTH)](https://www.certh.gr) and the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)](https://www.bsc.es/). EVERSE will be interfacing with the [EOSC science clusters](https://science-clusters.eu) and their emerging use cases:

- [ENVRI Community](https://envri.eu): Essential Climate Variables
- [Life Science RI](https://lifescience-ri.eu/home.html): The Workflow Execution Service backend with RO-Crate
- [ESCAPE](https://projectescape.eu/): Particle physics and astrophysics in the Dark Matter Science Project
- [PaNOSC](https://www.panosc.eu/): Photon and neutron science through LEAPS/LENS
- [SSHOC](https://sshopencloud.eu/): UDPipe language processing suite
