## *Software for the Communities by the Communities*

The EVERSE project aims to create a framework for research software and code excellence, collaboratively designed and championed by the research communities, in pursuit of building a **European network of Research Software Quality** and setting the foundations of a future **Virtual Institute for Research Software Excellence**.

## Objectives

This project, funded by Horizon Europe call [HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-02](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-infra-2023-eosc-01-02) ([#101057344](https://doi.org/10.3030/101057344)) has the objectives:

1. Build a collaborative, community-led structure for evaluating, verifying, and improving the quality of research software and code, by actively involving researchers, software developers, and other stakeholders in the research community.
2. Leverage existing tools and resources to support the evaluation, verification and improvement of research software and code quality, based on existing practices and standards across research communities represented by the five EOSC Science Clusters.
3. Establish a sustainable and collaborative ecosystem of stakeholders across the research communities associated with the five EOSC Science Clusters to ensure research software and code quality assurance and support the advancement of reliable and reproducible research.
4. Provide a framework that will ensure appropriate recognition, reward, and career development for researchers and RSEs who implement research software and code quality assurance practices and policies.

## RSQkit

The framework for research software excellence will incorporate aspects involving community curation, quality assessment, and best practices for research software. This collective knowledge will be captured in the **Research Software Quality toolkit** (RSQkit), a knowledge base to gather and curate expertise that will contribute to high-quality software and code across different disciplines.

By embedding the RSQkit and services into the EOSC Science Clusters, EVERSE will demonstrate improvements in the quality of research software and maximise its reuse, leading to standardised software development practices and sustainable research software. Furthermore, we will drive recognition of software and support career progress for developers, from researchers who code to RSEs, raising their capacity to guarantee software quality.

## Ambition

EVERSE ultimate ambition is to contribute towards a cultural change where research software is recognized as a first-class citizen of the scientific process and the people that contribute to it are credited for their efforts.

EVERSE is coordinated by the [Centre for Research and Technology hellas (CERTH)](https://www.certh.gr). EVERSE will be interfacing with the [EOSC science clusters](https://eosc-portal.eu/esfri-thematic-cluster-projects) and their emerging use cases:

- [ENVRI-FAIR](https://envri.eu/home-envri-fair/): Essential Climate Variables
- [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/): The Workflow Execution Service backend with RO-Crate
- [ESCAPE](https://projectescape.eu/): Particle physics and astrophysics in the Dark Matter Science Project
- [PaNOSC](https://www.panosc.eu/): Photon and neutron science through LEAPS/LENS
- [SSHOC](https://sshopencloud.eu/): UDPipe language processing suite
