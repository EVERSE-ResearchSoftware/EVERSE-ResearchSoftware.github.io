## Overview

The **EVERSE** project aims to create a framework for research software and code excellence, collaboratively designed and championed by the research communities, in pursuit of building a European network of Research Software Quality and setting the foundations of a future Virtual Institute for Research Software Excellence.

Funded under the Horizon Europe call HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-02 (#101129744), **EVERSE** focuses on developing a collaborative and community-led structure to evaluate, verify, and improve the quality of research software and code. By leveraging existing tools, practices, and standards from the five EOSC Science Clusters, the project will build a sustainable ecosystem of stakeholders dedicated to ensuring software quality, reliability, and reproducibility in research. Moreover, **EVERSE** will contribute to recognition and career development frameworks for researchers and Research Software Engineers (RSEs) who implement best practices in software quality assurance.

## Ambition
The ultimate ambition of **EVERSE** is to contribute towards a cultural change where research software is recognized as a first-class citizen of the scientific process and the people that contribute to it are credited for their efforts.

EVERSE is coordinated by the [Centre for Research and Technology hellas (CERTH)](https://www.certh.gr) and the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)](https://www.bsc.es/). EVERSE will be interfacing with the [EOSC science clusters](https://science-clusters.eu) and their emerging use cases:

- [ENVRI Community](https://envri.eu): Essential Climate Variables
- [Life Science RI](https://lifescience-ri.eu/home.html): The Workflow Execution Service backend with RO-Crate
- [ESCAPE](https://projectescape.eu/): Particle physics and astrophysics in the Dark Matter Science Project
- [PaNOSC](https://www.panosc.eu/): Photon and neutron science through LEAPS/LENS
- [SSHOC](https://sshopencloud.eu/): UDPipe language processing suite
