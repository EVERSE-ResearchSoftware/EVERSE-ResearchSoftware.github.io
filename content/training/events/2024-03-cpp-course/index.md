## Welcome to the [10th iteration of a C++ course for the high energy physics community](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1370681/)

Please note that this course is organised for the High Energy Physics (HEP) community. Please provide details about your affiliation to a HEP laboratory or university during the registration process. 

The morning lectures of this event will be held in a hybrid format, i.e. in meeting rooms at CERN and also via zoom connections. The afternoon training sessions will be held in various rooms at CERN. 

Please note only physically attending students will be able to attend the hands-on training. Two registration forms are available for in person or remote participation.

If it is possible for you to attend the event on premises, we would encourage you to do so, as we believe the training effect will be higher.

The course is based on material developed originally by Sebastien Ponce and further extended mainly in collaboration with Bernhard Gruber and Stephan Hageboeck.
