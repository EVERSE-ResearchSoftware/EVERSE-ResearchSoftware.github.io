### Andreas Kosmider

#### *Falling Walls Foundation gGmbH*

Andreas Kosmider is a physicist with expertise in experimental astro-particle physics, energy systems, and fusion technologies. He earned his Ph.D. for pioneering work on background suppression techniques in direct neutrino mass measurements with the KATRIN collaboration. Later, he transitioned to project management and played a pivotal role in the KATRIN experiment, the world's most precise direct neutrino mass measurement. In 2016, he joined the Helmholtz Association, where he led strategic digitalization initiatives and oversaw the Helmholtz Incubator for Information and Data Science. Andreas has a passion for the performing arts, having participated in over 35 theater productions, founded theater companies, and bridged the gap between science and theater. He has also been actively involved in various academic, social, cultural, and political organizations, displaying a keen interest in organizing large events and campaigns. As of September 2023, Andreas serves as the managing director of the Falling Walls Foundation.
