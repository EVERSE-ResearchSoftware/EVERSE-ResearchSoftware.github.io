The EVERSE project consists of 18 partners from organisations and institutes all across Europe. As a consortium we gather skills from all kinds of sciences that use programming for their research: astronomy and particle physics, photon and neutron science, environmental sciences, social sciences and humanities, and life sciences.

**Follow the links to get to know us.**
