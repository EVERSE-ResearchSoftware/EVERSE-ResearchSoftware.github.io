Stefan Roiser is leading [Work Package 5](/workpackages/05_capacity_and_recognition/). He is based at CERN where he leads a team of scientists and engineers working on performance optimisation and hardware acceleration of high energy physics simulation software applications.

Stefan has had major coordination roles in the past in software and computing as part of the [LHCb Experiment](https://lhcb-outreach.web.cern.ch/) at CERN. He programs mainly in C++ and Cuda/HIP but has also come across Fortran, which he has not (had to) use in his career until recently.
