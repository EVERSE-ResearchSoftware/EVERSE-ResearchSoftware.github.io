Alexia works as the Communications Officer for the EVERSE project.

After graduating as a veterinary surgeon from the University of Surrey, she realised that her passion lies more in crafting words than cutting animals open, and she went on to study a master’s in Science Communication at Imperial College London.

A science communicator and writer with a focus on storytelling, she has experience communicating across a range of disciplines — from veterinary medicine, IT, particle physics and quantum computing. Some of her previous roles include editor of veterinary newsite Vet Report, working in the central communications team in CERN’s International Relations department, IdeaSquare (the innovation space at CERN), and more recently at the Open Quantum Institute (OQI).

In her free time, Alexia write articles for the veterinary profession and can be found doing something creative (usually embroidery), out in nature, or spending time with her cat.
