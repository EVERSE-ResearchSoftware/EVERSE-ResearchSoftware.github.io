Patrick co-leads [Work Package 2](/workpackages/02_best_practices) and is an editor for the [RSQKit](https://everse.software/RSQKit).
He is Technology Lead for Software Quality at the Netherlands eScience Center.
In this role, he makes sure software best practices are available to research software engineers (RSEs) and provides strategic advice about software technology in general.

In his past lives, he was an astronomer/cosmologist and an RSE at the eScience Center.
His engineering career led him from art history, through particle physics, to linguistics; from data, through efficient computing, to machine learning.
He likes to call himself a generalist.
