Graeme Stewart led [Work Package
1](/workpackages/01_framework_european_network/) until Spring 2025, while he
was a member of the CERN *Software Development for Experiments* group in the
Experimental Physics Department. Graeme currently works at the Deutsches
Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in the IT department.

Graeme has played a leading role in the [HEP Software
Foundation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org). He has had major roles in
software as part of the [ATLAS Experiment](https://www.atlas.cern). One of his
current strong interests is in using the [Julia Programming
Language](https://julialang.org) and its use as a future programming language
for high-energy physics and light sources.
