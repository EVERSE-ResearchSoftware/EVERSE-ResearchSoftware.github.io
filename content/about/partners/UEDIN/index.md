 The University of Edinburgh [(UEDIN)]((https://www.ed.ac.uk)) was founded in 1583 as the first true civic university in the United Kingdom and is home to almost 50,000 students and over 5,000 academic staff. At the heart of its mission is ground-breaking research that addresses pressing global challenges and pushes the boundaries of knowledge. Recent investment by UK and Scottish Governments has accelerated Edinburghâ€™s capacity to deliver trusted data-driven innovation across ten sectors, firmly grounded in interdisciplinary collaboration with industry and the public sector, to achieve real-world impact.
