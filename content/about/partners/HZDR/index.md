The Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf [(HZDR)](https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=0) conducts cutting-edge research with a long-term focus in the fields of energy, health and matter. We explore fundamental phenomena of nature. Unique research infrastructures provide insight into processes under extreme conditions. We contribute know-how to the development of future materials and information technologies, but also novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods in cancer research â€“ from the fundamentals in natural and life sciences to medical application. We are facilitating the transition to a sustainable industry and the transformation of energy systems towards a green society. Furthermore we also support the digital transformation of all our science domains by offering expertise and services for research software and research data lifecycles as well as the application of AI methods.
