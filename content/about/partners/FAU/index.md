The Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg [(FAU)](https://www.fau.eu) is one of the largest universities in Germany. With its five faculties, FAU offers an almost unique scope of subjects ranging from the Humanities to Law and Economics as well as Sciences, Medicine and Engineering. The close collaboration between the single disciplines is reflected by the University’s Mission Statement "Advance through Networks". FAU thus offers perfect conditions for interdisciplinary research and learning to students and scientists alike.

The Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics [(ECAP)](https://ecap.nat.fau.de) was founded as a focus research centre of the FAU. ECAP combines expertise in the fields of neutrino, TeV gamma, X-ray and optical astronomy as well as development of novel detectors. It is a major player in neutrino astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy and X-ray astronomy. The scientists at ECAP have long-standing, leading expertise in construction and operation of large-scale experiments and in their scientific exploitation (data analysis and interpretation).
