The [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl) (est. 2012) is the Dutch national centre of expertise for innovative software solutions in academic research. Bringing together knowledge, people and institutions, the eScience Center builds and applies software to enhance the use of digital technology in research. 

By sharing the digital competences needed to develop and apply research software, we reinforce researchersâ€™ technological skills and knowledge. Our vision is to establish a robust research community, in which all investigators in all domains are able to exploit advanced digital technologies to answer curiosity-driven questions.
