 The National Centre for Scientific Research [(CNRS)](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) is a major player in basic research on the global stage and the only organisation in France that is active in all fields of science. Its unique position as a specialist in multiple fields means that it can bring together different scientific disciplines to shed light on and gain insight into current global challenges, in partnership with public sector, social and economic stakeholders. Together the sciences are used to bring about sustainable progress that benefits the whole of society. 

The CNRS’s scientific management includes the ten institutes that steer the organisation’s research strategy within their discipline. Being one of these, The National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics [(IN2P3)](https://www.in2p3.cnrs.fr/en) performs research in the field of the 'two infinites'. The Laboratoire d’Annecy de Physique des Particules [(LAPP)](https://www.lapp.in2p3.fr/en/news) and Laboratoire de Physique des 2 Infinis Irène Joliot-Curie [(IJCLab)](https://www.ijclab.in2p3.fr/en/home/), involved in the project, are Joint Research Units led by IN2P3.
