The Square Kilometer Array Observatory[SKAO](https://www.skao.int/en)  is an intergovernmental organisation comprised of member states and partners from five continents whose mission is to build and operate cutting-edge radio telescopes to transform our understanding of the Universe and deliver benefits to society through global collaboration and innovation.  The SKAO’s mid-frequency telescope is under construction in the Karoo region of South Africa, while the SKAO’s low-frequency telescope is being built on Wajarri Yamaji Country in Western Australia. Complementary by design, these telescopes will both be the most powerful radio telescopes on Earth in their respective frequency ranges.
