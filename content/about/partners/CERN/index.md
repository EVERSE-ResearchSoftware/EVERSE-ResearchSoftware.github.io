[CERN](https://www.home.cern) (Conseil Europ√©en de la Recherche Nucleaire, *European Council for Nuclear Research*) is one of the largest international organisations for particle and accelerator physics. Founded in 1954, it connects people from Europe and abroad and across different domains such as theoretical and experimental particle physics, accelerator physics, engineering and technology. It is home to the world's biggest collider, the Large Hadron collider (LHC). Besides the particle-physics aspects, CERN also offers opportunities for software development, international and human relations as well as outreach and education.
