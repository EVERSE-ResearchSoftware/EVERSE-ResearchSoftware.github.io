Barcelona Supercomputing Center-Centro Nacional de Supercomputación [(BSC-CNS)](https://www.bsc.es) is the national supercomputing centre in Spain. BSC-CNS is specialised in high performance computing (HPC) and manages [MareNostrum 5](https://www.bsc.es/ca/marenostrum/marenostrum-5), one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe. The centre manages the Red Española de Supercomputación (RES), and is a hosting member of the Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe (PRACE) initiative. Also, it actively participates in the main European HPC initiatives. With a total staff of more than 900 R&D experts and professionals, BSC has been successful in attracting talent, and our research focuses on five fields: Computer Sciences, Life Sciences, Earth Sciences, Computer Applications in Science and Engineering, and Computational Social Sciences and Humanities. Our research lines are developed within the framework of European Union research funding programmes, Spanish and Catalan public research calls and collaborations with leading companies.
