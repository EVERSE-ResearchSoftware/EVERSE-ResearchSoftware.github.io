<!-- The EVERSE project consists of 18 partners from organisations and institutes all across Europe. As a consortium we gather skills from all kinds of sciences that use programming for their research: astronomy and particle physics, photon and neutron science, environmental sciences, social sciences and humanities, and life sciences. -->
This page presents the organizations and institutes collaborating with the EVERSE project, representing its extensive network both within and beyond Europe. These partnerships aim to address the opportunities and challenges encountered by Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and to facilitate the organization of existing open software challenges.
