Each research community has its own techniques for computing-based research. Work package 2 works towards assessing all these approaches and developing common grounds for best practices applicable to all developers. The Research Software Quality kit [(RSQkit)](/services/rsqkit/) will be a knowledge hub that collects existing expertise while ensuring improvement.

The curated best practices are gathered across four pillars: technical quality, FAIR principles, Openness and Software Sustainability. They are used to find a common framework and act as measurables for indicators of software quality. Woven into the RSQkit, these practices will be incorporated into the future Virtual Institute driven by WP1.
