Execution, supervision and the governance of EVERSE is handled by work package 6, led by the Centre for Research & Technology Hellas [(CERTH)](https://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx) and the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre [(BSC)](https://www.bsc.es). Besides overseeing the smooth running of the project, WP6 is also in charge of the allocated budget and track risks and opportunities.

The project lead additionally appoints a Scientific Advisory Committee, coordinates the management board (includes work package leaders) and chairs the General Assembly (one representative of each consortium partner). As a last important point, WP6 ensures the implementation of ethical, legal and societal implication aspects.
