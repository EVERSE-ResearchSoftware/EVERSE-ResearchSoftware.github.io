The main goal of this WP is to establish a *European network of Research Software Quality*, building towards a *Virtual Institute of Research Software Excellence*, in order to create a framework of community curation that ensures quality of software. We will engage with various science communities, and build direct links with other European and international organisations, including the EOSC Association and EOSC Exchange, to ensure coherence and enhance the impact of the network. The project will focus on promoting and enhancing software quality through a range of activities such as seminars, workshops, newsletters, hackathons, webinars, and dissemination campaigns to foster inclusion and maximise impact.
