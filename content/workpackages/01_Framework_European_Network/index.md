Work package 1 aims to establish a network dedicated to *research software quality*, and from this build towards a *Virtual Institute of Research Software Excellence*. By connecting to science communities where coding and programming is done on a daily basis, we aim to build a framework where research software quality is ensured and properly recognised as a top-tier tool for modern scientific operations.

While we draw on the expertise of existing communities and individuals, EVERSE also offers a set of activities to engage with software development teams. Seminars, workshops, webinars and onboarding events, such as hackathons, are organised to share and learn about different skill sets; while newsletters and social media updates keep the community informed about the latest developments.
