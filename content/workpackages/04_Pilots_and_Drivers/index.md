This WP serves as the interface of EVERSE to and from the EOSC-Future science clusters. It collects and aggregates well established practices on software engineering processes and training from the various science domains as a starting point. Based on these experiences, a software assessment process based on the metrics from WP2 and tools from WP3 is established and then also adapted to the needs of the science clusters.

## Work Package Leads

- Guido Juckeland (HZDR)
- Caterina Doglioni (UniMan)

## Participants

BSC, CERTH, CU, ELIXIR-Hub, OpenAIRE, UPM, UvA, CU
