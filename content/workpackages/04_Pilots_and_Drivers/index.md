This WP serves as the interface of EVERSE to and from the EOSC-Future science clusters. It collects and aggregates well established practices on software engineering processes and training from the various science domains as a starting point. Based on these experiences, a software assessment process based on the metrics from WP2 and tools from WP3 is established and then also adapted to the needs of the science clusters.
