This WP connects existing individual tools and services with developers and Science Clusters in three steps: collecting existing tools and services for software (including all forms of executable code) quality, linking them in common pipelines or frameworks, integrating them with platforms used in the Science Clusters. This WP collaborates with the Science Clusters identified in WP4 that helps to shape the developed tools to their needs.
