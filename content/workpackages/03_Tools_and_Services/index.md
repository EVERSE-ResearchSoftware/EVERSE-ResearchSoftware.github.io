An essential component of work package 3 is the tight collaboration with all other EVERSE WPs as well as with the Science Clusters that shape the infrastructure of the European Open Science Clouds. WP3 set three goals:

1.Establish a “technology watch” that identifies and gathers existing software tools to ensure workflow quality.
2.Strengthen these services to make their integration into pipelines and communities easier.
3.Develop a dashboard of indicators for software quality in the Science Clusters.

The final catalogue of tools will be implemented into the Research Software Quality kit [(RSQkit)](/services/rsqkit/) and is based on FAIR principles for software.

This WP collaborates tightly with other WPs and notably with the Science Clusters identified in WP4 that helps to shape the developed tools to their needs.
