Software and computing are becoming more and more essential tools for research, which are used on a daily basis. Yet proper acknowledgement of the work that is going into the development of such programmes is not yet adequate. Work package 5 has launched an analysis of existing award schemes and trainings. From this a set of guidelines for acknowledging researcher contributions in software development and training will be established. In EVERSE, we consider it imperative to  educate (early career) scientists and engineers when entering the world of software engineering and to recognise the effort they have put into creating powerful modern tools for data analysis.

While the work package will aim at creating a common framework, training methods will be tailored to the respective research communities (astronomy & particle physics, photon & neutron science, environmental science, life sciences, social sciences & humanities), so that developers can focus their learning on the most important tools for their discipline.
